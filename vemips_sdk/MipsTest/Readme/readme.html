            <h1>Setting up your project for GDB Debugging</h1>

            <p>This makefile project enables you to debug your native C/C++ code for debugging on microcontrollers, remote Linux machines or locally on Windows. You can configure this project to use your own compilers or build tools. These instructions will cover how to setup for these scenarios. At the end you will find instructions on enabling intellisense, a reference on the project propery parameters you may use in build scripts and a description of the files used in this project.</p>

            <p><a href="http://aka.ms/vsiot">Visit our IoT Development page</a> to keep up with our latest offerings in this space.</p>
                     
            <h1>Microcontroller Debugging</h1>
            <p>You can debug code running on microcontrollers (MCU) with this extension. Your MCU target must have on board on chip debugging capabilities or you can use an off board interface such as a <a href="https://www.segger.com/">Segger J-Link probe</a>.</p>
                
            <h2>Project properties for remote GDB debugging an MCU</h2>
            <p>On the project properties page go to the Debugging tab and chose the OCD GDB Debugger.</p>
            <img src="images\ocdproperties.png"/>
            <p>The OCD Debugger Executcable will be the GDB executable for the MCU you are using, e.g. arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe from the <a href="https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded">ARM GCC tools</a> if you are using an ARM based MCU. Specify the GDB server address provided by your OCD, and the location of your firmware binary that was compiled with debug symbols</p>
            
            <p>Before launching your debug session you will need to launch your GDB server that bridges to your MCU. The ones we have tried are <a href="https://www.segger.com/">Segger</a>, <a href="http://openocd.org/">OpenOCD</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD">pyOCD</a>.</p>
            
            <h1>Remote GDB Debugging</h1>
            <p>We recommend our <a href="http://aka.ms/vslinuxext">VC++ for Linux Development Tools</a> if you are targetting Linux. If those tools have a limitation that requires you to continue using this template please let us know via VS Feedback or <a href="http://aka.ms/vsgdb-feedback">UserVoice</a>.</p>
            
            <p>To use the remote GDB debugging capabilities of this extension you must enable SSH on both your local Windows development enviornment and your remote Linux target. Currently we do not support SSH certificates with passphrases. On the Linux target you must have GDB available and compilers, e.g. gcc or g++. We will describe the project properties to setup first and then follow with a description of setting up SSH.</p>
            
            <h2>Project properties for remote GDB debugging on Linux</h2>
            
            <p>You will notice there is no source included with this project type. You should either add your existing sources here or add new C/C++ files to the project to get started. You will also need the remote machine DNS name or IP address, your remote user name, your SSH cert, and the working directory on the remote machine.</p>
            
            <p>Once all of that ready right click on the project properties, then on the Debugger tab set the debugger to launch to Remote GDB.</p>

            <img src="images\debugproperties.png"/>
            
            <p>Here you need to set my host name, user name, private key and the secure shell you want to use. When using PuTTY tools you need to use plink as that is the tool used for piping commands as opposed to the interactive PuTTY terminal. Set the remote working directory and remote executable. You can specify arguments for the executable if needed. If GDB is on the path on the Linux machine that is all that needs to be specified. If GDB needs to be launched in a particular way, e.g. with sudo for access to GPIO pins, you can customize this line. Apply those changes so we can see these values as we create our build command.</p>
            
            <p>Go to the NMake tab.</p>
            
            <img src="images\remotebuild.png"/>
            
            <p>Click the Build Command Line to open it for edit, this way you will be able to see the parameter names get evaluated</p>
            
            <img src="images\remotebuildcmdline.png"/>
            
            <p>This example show using pscp from PuTTY for copying files to the remote target machine. This is done in combination with our parameters from the build tab for the private key, user, host and remote working directory. When you are copying files this way to a Linux host make sure the remote directories you are using already exist. Next specify the build command line with the remote executable name as commands passed via plink. Note here if there are spaces in your parameter values you should escape them with quotes. We specify these on the build command line of the Nmake tab of the project properties. You can also invoke remote scripts or make to build if you have that setup.</p> 
            
            <h1>Configuring SSH</h1>
            
            <h2>Local SSH Clients</h2>
            <p>First you will need to get a local SSH client. You may the SSH client of your choice, for example the <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH">Win32 Port of OpenSSH</a>, <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY</a>, <a href="http://mingw.org/">MinGW</a>, or <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>. The SSH client will be used to securely tunnel Machine Interface commands to a remote GDB executable.</p>
            <p>For PuTTY you need to use plink.exe as the SSH Executable. You'll probably also want the full putty.exe client and pscp.exe for copying files to your Linux machine. You will need puttygen.exe for creating your private key for SSH access. The tools in the Win32 OpenSSH port and from Putty can be used in the NMake build step in VS. Note that MinGW/Cygwin based SSH is fine for the SSH Executable but cannot be used from the build step in VS due to how we launch processes there.</p>
            <h2>Creating your keys on Windows</h2>
            <p>At this time we cannot support certificates that have a pass phrase.</p>
            <p>To generate private/public keys for Win 32 OpenSSH use the ssh-keygen utility as follows.<br/>
            <code>
ssh-keygen.exe -t rsa -f yourkey
            </code>
            <br/>Your private key will be in the file spesified above as yourkey and the public key will be in a file yourkey.pub.</p>
            <p>For PuTTY you need to create a certificate usable for SSH authentication by running puttygen and clicking generate. Save the private and public keys to use in subsequent steps.</p>

            <h2>Adding your public keys on the Linux machine</h2>
            <p>On your Linux machine you need to add the public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. Each public key should be on one line. You can do this as follows if the file already exists.
            <br/><code>
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
            </code><br/>
            In the editor this invokes right click on a new line to insert the copied public key text. The screenshot above shows my file that has two keys added to it. Hit ctrl-x to exit which prompts you to save.</p>
            <p>If the file does not already exist do the following first:</p>
            <pre>
    mkdir ~/.ssh
    touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 0700 ~/.ssh
    chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
            </pre>
            <h2>Connecting with SSH</h2>
            <p>To connect from an SSH client:</p>
            <pre>
    ssh.exe -i privatekey user@host
            </pre> 
            <p>To connect from PuTTY load your saved session then go to Connection, Data and set your user name. Under Connection, SSH, Auth and add the private key you saved. Go back to the session page and save it. Now you can open a session using keys without a password.</p>
            
            <h1>Local GDB debugging</h1>
            <p>In addition to Linux you can use the GDB Debugger extension on Windows, for example using MinGW. Note that you will want your MinGW bin folder, e.g. C:\MinGW\bin, on your path. That provides us with the GNU compilers, gcc, g++ and the gdb debugger that we’ll describe here. On the project properties on the debug tab change the Debugger to Launch drop down from Remote GDB to Local GDB. For the options specify the full path to where your source is, do not let the selection dialog use the "." convention. Specify your executable name and gdb is fine as it is on your path. Hit apply so you can see the values on the debugging tab get evaluated in the next step.</p>
            
            <p>Now tell VS how to build this. On the nmake tab edit the build command line. Use gcc or g++ to build your source which also works as they should be on your global path already, and pass it the source in your working directory, tell it to emit the debugging symbols and output the executable name you specified in your working directory. This should look something like this:</p>
            <pre>
    g++ $(LocalWorkingDirectory)\source.cpp -g -o  $(LocalWorkingDirectory)\$(LocalExecutable)
            </pre>
            
            <h1>Enable Intellisense</h1>
            <p>To enable Intellisense add the paths to your dependencies that are external to your project on the appropriate fields on the VC++ Directories tab of the project properties.</p>
            
            <h1>Project Properties</h1>
            <p>The project properties from the debug tab are all available for use in the NMake build command line. Note that you can set values for both Remote and Local GDB for use in your build command line even though you are only launching one or the other. The properties available are:</p>
            <pre>
    Private Key:                   $(PrivateKey)
    Secure Shell Executable:       $(SecureShellExecutable)
    Remote Working Directory:      $(RemoteWorkingDirectory)
    Remote Executable Name:        $(RemoteExecutable)
    Remote Executable Arguments:   $(RemoteExecutableArguments)
    Remote Debugger Executable:    $(RemoteDebuggerExecutable)
    Local Working Directory:       $(LocalWorkingDirectory)
    Local Executable:              $(LocalExecutable)
    Local Executable Arguments:    $(LocalExecutableArguments)
    Local Debugger Executable:     $(LocalDebuggerExecutable)
    Local Debugger Server Address: $(LocalDebuggerServerAddress)
            </pre>
            <p>For targeting Linux your source must be built on a remote Linux machine. By invoking pscp from the build command line you can copy your source(s) to the remote Linux machine. Using plink you can invoke the compiler on the source on the remote Linux machine. The plink command is capable of executing any command supported by the remote target.</p>
            <p>Here is an example remote file copy and build command line using PuTTY Tools:</p>
            <pre>
pscp.exe -i $(PrivateKey) source.cpp  $(RemoteUserName)@$(RemoteHostName):$(RemoteWorkingDirectory)/source.cpp
plink.exe $(RemoteUserName)@$(RemoteHostName) -i $(PrivateKey) "cd $(RemoteWorkingDirectory);g++ -g source.cpp -o $(RemoteExecutable)"
            </pre>
            <p>Note that we do not support MinGW/Cygwin SSH tools invoked from the build command line due to how we launch that process. You can use the PowerShell tools port of OpenSSH here including their implementation of sftp.</p>
            <p>Here is an example of building on the local Windows machine (presuming g++ is on the global path).</p>
            <pre>
g++ $(LocalWorkingDirectory)\source.cpp -g -o  $(LocalWorkingDirectory)\$(LocalExecutable)
            </pre>
            
            <h1>GDB Makefile project assets and other files</h1>
            <p>The Assets folder in this project contains xaml files we use to change the project properties tabs. These may need to be manually updated in future revisions of this extension, if so we will provide instructions.</p>
            <p>The Readme folder contains this file, supporting style sheets, images and a shorter text version of instructions. These may be safely removed if you have no need for them.</p>
